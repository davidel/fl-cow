The preload library perform Copy On Write on files having hard links.
The environment variable FLCOW_PATH tells the library which paths are
allowed to be FL-COWed. For example :

FLCOW_PATH=/home/davide/arch-projects/:/home/davide/test-flcow/

Anything that is inside :

/home/davide/arch-projects/*

and inside /home/davide/test-flcow/*

will be FL-COWed if its st_nlink > 1. To have the library effective
you simply set your FLCOW_PATH :

export FLCOW_PATH=...

and you also set :

export LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/usr/lib/libflcow.so

I usually export this in my developer shell. To test the library after
a build you can use :

$ LD_PRELOAD=./fl-cow/.libs/libflcow.so ./test/flcow-test

Or simply :

$ make check



Enjoy,
